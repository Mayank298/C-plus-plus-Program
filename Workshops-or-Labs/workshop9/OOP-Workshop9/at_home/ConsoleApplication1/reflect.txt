1) String capacity is the size of the char array while the length is the actual string length which is used by the string element.
   yes its still work if we are giving string a more capacity then actual length. rest of the string element will become a null.
   
2) Its always good to use the library which is given by the system. it is possible that own library may contain any bug so may be
    it can stop our program.

3) Yes we need to set the String first to safe empty state its show that string is empty and it have only null value.
   yes we need to clean the memory at the end of the class. No we can not add two string with the possible data loss.
   its easy to use string rather then always using the char pointer or char array.
