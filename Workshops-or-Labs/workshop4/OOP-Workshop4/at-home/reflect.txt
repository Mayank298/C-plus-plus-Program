Q:1)Sefe empty state is setting a object to the non valid state. 
    Like for integer is set to the zero or and for any char to set to the null pointer.
	for Passenger 
	We can set char array of name or destination to set to 0 or'\0' or to nullptr
	everyone are same.
Q:2)If the Passenger having more then one constructors the for default constructors
    will set object to Safe empty, while the constructors with argument will set the 
    value to the valid state for that object.
Q:3)In this workshop i learned what is constructors and how to overload the constructors
    and also learn what is the safe empty state is and how it work with object.
